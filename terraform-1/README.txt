Modules are a way to organize and reuse Terraform code. They are a self-contained unit of Terraform configuration that can be used as building blocks to create more complex infrastructure. Here is an example of how modules can be used in Terraform:

Let's say you want to create an AWS VPC with a public subnet, private subnet, and an EC2 instance in the private subnet. You can create a module for each of these resources and use them to create your infrastructure.

In this example, the main.tf file uses the vpc, public_subnet, private_subnet, and ec2 modules to create an AWS VPC with a public subnet, private subnet, and an EC2 instance in the private subnet. The modules each have their own main.tf file, which contains the resources and variables for that module.
